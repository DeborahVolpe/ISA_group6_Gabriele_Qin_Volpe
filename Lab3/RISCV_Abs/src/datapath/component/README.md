In this folder are present all the VHDL files necessary for the datapath implementation:

- abs.vhd that implements absolute value operation;

- adder_subtractor.vhd that implements an adder subtractor;

- AndN_bit.vhd that implements an and bit a bit between two inputs on N bits;

- barrel_shifter.vhd that implements a rigth barrel shifter;

- bN_5to1.vhd that implements a multiplexer with 5 inputs and 1 outputs;

- datapath.vhd that implements the complete datapath, using all the other files;

- LUI_AUIPC.vhd that implements the LUI and the AUIPC operations;

- XorN_bit.vhd that implements an xor bit a bit between two inputs on N bits;

- ZeroN_bit.vhd that it is equal to zero when the inputs are equal.
